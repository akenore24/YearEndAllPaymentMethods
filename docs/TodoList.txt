1. prompt 
Let's keep organizing the csv file. write me a separate python file which finds all the ONLINE TRANSFER TO KENORE A WAY2SAVE SAVINGS.... and removes from the csv file. Becasuse these are not expenses but transaction from check to savings and it is bugging a little bit.

Note give me a clean and orgainzed python file and feel free to change the file name to more relates to what it does
