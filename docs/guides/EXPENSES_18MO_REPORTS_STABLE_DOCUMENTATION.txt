# 📊 expenses_18mo_reports_stable.py — Future‑You Documentation

> **Purpose:** This document explains *what this project does*, *why it exists*, *how to run it safely*, and *how to modify it without breaking trust*. Written for **future‑you** when memory is fuzzy but accuracy matters.

---

## 1️⃣ Why this script exists (the philosophy)

This script was created to solve **one core problem**:

> *“I need to understand my real spending over 18 months — accurately, consistently, and without re‑doing work.”*

Key principles behind this project:

* **Stability over features**
* **Explicit categories > clever automation**
* **One authoritative categorization source**
* **Rollback‑friendly development**
* **Readable outputs (PDF first)**

This is *not* a toy script. It is a **financial audit tool**.

---

## 2️⃣ The trusted baseline (⚠️ very important)

### ✅ Canonical version

```
expenses_18mo_reports_stable.py
```

This file is the **gold standard**.

If a future version:

* produces totals that “feel off”
* shows duplicate vendors
* breaks category rollups

👉 **Compare against this file first.**

> Rule: *Never delete or overwrite the stable file.*

---

## 3️⃣ Input expectations

### Required CSV columns

Your CSV **must** contain:

* Master Category
* Subcategory
* Date
* Location
* Payee
* Description
* Payment Method
* Amount

### Amount rules

* Expenses may be **negative or positive**
* Script calculates:

  * **NET total** (signed)
  * **ABS total** (absolute spending)

---

## 4️⃣ Authoritative categorization system

### 📌 This is NOT inferred automatically

All categorization is driven by:

> **Deduplicated, Simplified Description Patterns (Organized)**

This list is **authoritative**.

If something is miscategorized:

1. Fix the pattern list
2. Re‑run the script
3. Do *not* hardcode one‑off exceptions

### Roll‑up rules

Examples:

* `XCEL` → **XCEL ENERGY‑PSCO XCELENERGY**
* `DOMINO` → **DOMINO'S**
* `WM SUPERCENTER` → **WAL‑MART**
* `COMCAST CABLE` → **COMCAST‑XFINITY**

Short forms are always normalized into **official labels**.
